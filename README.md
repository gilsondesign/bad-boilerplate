## Local computer setup (for Grunt/Sass)

2. Install Ruby (http://rubyinstaller.org)
3. Be sure to check the checkbox "Add Ruby executable to your PATH"
4. Restart your computer.
5. Run the following commands in Command Prompt with administrator priviledges: `npm install -g grunt-cli`, `gem install sass`

6. Log out of and back into Windows (to ensure the path vars have refreshed)

## How to use Grunt

4. Code away!
